              For more than 25 years of social work and dharma teaching, Ajarn Hartanto Gunawan
              had introduced Research Meditation, a unique style of meditation, that helped all of his students
              and practitioners overcome trauma and mental illnesses. Rescued victims, government officers,
              doctors, educators, wall street investors, and etc. have improved their mental well-being and
              strength, overcome their mental suffering and returned to school and workforce, with confidence
              and wisdom. The Research Meditation curriculum combines the principles that contribute to
              good mental health and well-being, beginning with the understanding of the Law of Nature
              which focuses on the Law of Cause and Effect, the Law of Action and Reaction, and the
              Impermanence.
              Participants will understand the profound impact that the Research Meditation has made on
              human development. Thus, it is very important to realize that mental education is an integral
              part of education, the most crucial ingredient that helps human beings navigate the complexity
              in today's world. In the past, all education in the whole world has put strong emphasis on taking
              care of the body in our daily lives. Al schools up to universities, they all have Physical Education
              (PE) 101 and PE 102 in all their curriculum. However, there has never been any curriculum in all
              educational institutions that teach Mental Education (ME) 101 and ME 102 to balance with
              PE 101 and PE 102. A healthy life is not only having a healthy body; it must be all, having a healthy
              mind, body, and mental state. Therefore, Mental Education (ME) is equally important as PE and
              ought to be part of a mandatory curriculum.
              If children receive proper education about how to cope with their mental states, it is an act of
              prevention to mental illnesses. Ultimately, if we implement mental education in schools and
              universities, our young generation will live life with wisdom. They will be taught to research and
              understand their mental states, how to overcome pain and fear, and to let go of negative
              thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and emotions of the past and future. They will enjoy living in the
              present moment with peace and happiness. One can experience the state of equanimity.
